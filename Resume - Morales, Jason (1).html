<h1>Educational Background<h1>
<h2>Elementary</h2>
<p>Schools in the US are nothing like the ones in the Phillipines. When I came to the first grade, I was already learning how to reach and write. The first class they put me in was for those with autism and disabilities, but in the end I was move to a differnet class where I continued how to read and write. in Second and Third Grade, Math was a weakness to me; and it showed when I was tutored by my parents. It didn't go well, but I managed to learn from mistakes. In fourth and fifth grade, there was an issue with my social skills and my reading. My reading improved when a friend of mine introduced me to a fantasy novel, but my social skills were still in need of improvement. There was nothing much about what I learned in Sixth Grade other than more math, science, history and literature.</p>

<h2>Middle School</h2>
<p>Middle school was the point where understood there was some importance to my education. Bullying has affected my education and the classes I attend, yet I continue to learn. My social skills improved along with recovering what I've learned from elementary and working from there. Math and Language Arts (literature) were the most important when I finished seventh grade. And in eighth grade, I learned those subjects were more important for what was to come in Highschool. I've also manage to learn things from industrial tech and woodshop class.</p>
<p>When I was young, I wanted to be an artist, but that changed when I was in Middle School. Bullying discouraged me, and it left me distancing myself from the subject. When I was introduced to video games and some inspiring books like "The Tripod Trilogy" and "Warrior Cats", I had to interest in two thing: Game Development and Story-Writing. And I carry that thought on when entering High School.</p>

<h2>High School and College</h2>
<p>The environement here was no different from Middle School, but I got use to it with the strict rule placed. During the ninth grade, My teachers from Language Arts and Math are inspiring, and I manage to learn some lessons in French. In the tenth grade, I took interest in coding while continuing my interest in story writing. The my focus was entirely on coding when I entered the eleventh and twelveth grade, and I have still got a lot to learn from those subjects.</p>
<p> When I graduated, I prepared to go to College in the Phillipines, and the teachers and lessons there were less different. It felt like highschool to me. So far, I've seen a lot of different methods to educate the students, but ethics here were, in my opinion, need of improvement. Overall, I actually learned more in coding than any of the other subjects.</p>
